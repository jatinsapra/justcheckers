== What is justCheckers? ==
justCheckers is an open source advanced checkers game built using Java. The aim 
of the project is to create a checkers game that:

    * handles skins and themes
    * handles multimedia
    * allows for network games
    * contains a powerful yet fun computer opponent
    * handles different checker rules 

Version 0.1 lets you play a game of checkers (standard American rules) against 
another player on the same computer.
